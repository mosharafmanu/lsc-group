# LSC Group — New Project Setup Checklist

Use this checklist every time you start a new WordPress project from this framework.

---

## Phase A — File Setup

- [ ] Copy `lsc-group/` theme folder directly into the new project's `wp-content/themes/`
      — ⚠ it must land flat as `wp-content/themes/<slug>/style.css`, not nested in a
      wrapper folder (e.g. `wp-content/themes/my-project/lsc-group/`), or WordPress
      won't recognise it as an activatable theme
- [ ] Rename the folder to the project slug (e.g. `acme-corp`)
- [ ] Remove the copied `.git/` (`rm -rf .git`) before running `git init` — `cp -r` carries
      over the starter's `origin` remote, which would point commits/pushes at the original
      `mosharafmanu/lsc-group` repo instead of your project's
- [ ] Run `bash bin/new-project.sh` to rename all prefixes in one pass (see `NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`)
- [ ] Update `style.css` header: Theme Name, Author URI, Description

---

## Phase B — WordPress Setup

- [ ] Activate the theme in WP Admin > Appearance > Themes
- [ ] Install and activate **Advanced Custom Fields PRO**
- [ ] Go to Custom Fields > Sync — import all field groups from `acf-json/`
- [ ] Run **Settings > Permalinks > Save** to flush rewrite rules

---

## Phase C — Design Tokens

- [ ] Open `style.css` and update the color values in `:root {}`
- [ ] Update `--lsc-font-heading` and `--lsc-font-body`
- [ ] Update Google Fonts URL in `functions.php`
- [ ] Review `--lsc-container-max` and `--lsc-section-padding-y` against the design grid
- [ ] Review button color logic in `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-outline`

---

## Phase D — Image Sizes

- [ ] Open `inc/image-sizes.php`
- [ ] Define the width ladder for this project (based on layout breakpoints and design grid)
- [ ] Define the `size_group` token map and variant map in `inc/helper-functions/responsive-picture.php` for this project
- [ ] After media is uploaded: run **Regenerate Thumbnails**

---

## Phase E — ACF Options Pages

- [ ] Go to WP Admin > Custom Fields > Options Pages
- [ ] Create the options pages this project needs (e.g. Site Settings, Blog Options)
- [ ] Configure the fields on those options pages to match the project's header/footer structure
- [ ] Update helper functions in `inc/helper-functions/site-settings.php` to match

---

## Phase F — Navigation

- [ ] Go to WP Admin > Appearance > Menus
- [ ] Create `Main Menu` and assign to the `mainMenu` location
- [ ] Create `Footer Menu` and assign to the `footerMenu` location

---

## Phase G — Site Settings (ACF Options)

- [ ] Go to WP Admin > Site Settings (or whatever the options page is named)
- [ ] Upload site logo
- [ ] Add header phone number
- [ ] Set header CTA button link and label
- [ ] Add footer tagline and contact details
- [ ] Add footer company registration entries
- [ ] Set footer copyright text (supports `{year}` for dynamic year)
- [ ] Set website credit text/link if needed

---

## Phase H — Build Sections from the Client Design

- [ ] For each section in the client design:
  1. Read the design — identify what fields an editor needs to control
  2. Name the layout (consistent `snake_case` or `kebab-case` for the project)
  3. Create the ACF layout in WP Admin > Custom Fields
  4. Create `template-parts/sections/{layout_name}.php`
  5. Build the section HTML using helper functions
  6. Test on a real page in WP Admin

See `ACF-PATTERNS.md` for the full section-building workflow.

---

## Phase I — Cleanup

- [ ] Remove or replace `screenshot.png` with a real theme screenshot
- [ ] Delete any ACF field groups that are not used by this project
- [ ] Review `inc/helper-functions/site-settings.php` and remove functions not used by this project

---

## Phase J — Performance and SEO

- [ ] Audit enqueued CSS/JS in `functions.php` and remove anything the project does not use
- [ ] Confirm images use `lsc_render_responsive_picture()` or correctly sized WordPress images instead of oversized originals
- [ ] Compress final image assets before launch, including `screenshot.png`
- [ ] Check lazy loading and fetch priority: hero/LCP image should load eagerly/high priority; below-fold images should lazy load
- [ ] Verify semantic heading order on every key page: one `h1`, logical `h2`/`h3` structure, no skipped structure caused by visual styling
- [ ] Add meaningful alt text for content images and empty alt text for decorative images
- [ ] Confirm page titles, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph data, and XML sitemap via the SEO plugin used on the project
- [ ] Test Core Web Vitals with Lighthouse/PageSpeed after the local or staging site is configured: LCP, CLS, INP
- [ ] Fix layout shifts from images, fonts, sticky header, sliders, forms, and embedded media
- [ ] Confirm crawl basics: clean permalinks, no accidental `noindex`, working `robots.txt`, no broken internal links
